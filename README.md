Backend: Java Spring <br />
Frontend: React JS <br />
Database: MySQL (AWS RDS) <br />

The sample data is stored in the AWS RDS database. The backend accesses to the data and provides an endpoint to retrieve the data that is stored in the database .The frontend fetches the data from this API and populates the data into a table and tree. Users can click the leaf node of the tree and see the corresponding cell highlighted. <br/>
